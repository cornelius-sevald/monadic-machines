Monadic Machines
----------------

Accompanying Haskell implementation of my MSc thesis.
Most interesting parts are in the ./src-lib/ folder
and the ./test/ folder.

Type
> cabal test
to run the test suite.
Note that it may take a few minutes,
and on some occasions uses *a lot* of memory.
In those cases you can retry.
All of the tests should pass.
